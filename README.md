# CS111-BlackJackProject

The first major project that I ever wrote in Java for Rutger's University's **Fall 2015 Introduction to Computer Science class (CS111).**
This is a combinatio of all the milestones assigned (Minus the extra credit, which consisted of building a GUI for this game using JavaFX). 

#### FINAL GRADES:
- Milestone One: 26/30
- Milestone Two: 32/35
- Milestone Three: 28/35
